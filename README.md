# Abstraction
A meaning oriented language.

In addition to the general Object Oriented Model, an orthographic layer is added to detail the meanings of each lexemes
For example, *keywords* and *qualifiers* will still remain in essence functionally the same as any other language; but 
rather than the concept of a "Keyword" or a "Qualifier", it is divided into meaning as contained by orthography and functional
meaning. Keywords can contain orthographic properties like suffixual, or prefixual, operative or derivative 
and optional or mandatory.

All the linguistics and the lexicon of the language can be user-defined, i.e., users can define an orthographic
infix that holds the functional meaning of subtraction; or a suffix that denotes complex numericals.

# The Division
A lexeme has two distinct properties when tokenized. 
	a. Positional
	b. Device
	
Lexeme positionals determines the orthographic meaning of the lexeme, accounting for where the occurances of the appointed
lexeme may be legal or illegal. Lexem devices annotates the functional meaning of the lexeme, i.e., symbolic, numerical, 
string, etc...
