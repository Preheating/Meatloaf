# Abstraction
In extension to major high level languages, this is an attempt to perform abstractions of barebone level concepts
into higher domains. Concepts such as **keywords** and **qualifiers** will be exposed to the user arena thus intrinsically 
implementable in a non ambiguous way.

The philosophy behind this implementation is in the idea that *everything* consisted of source code follows an objective
ruleset of reason and logic, but the orthography, in other words, the way and manner in which 
we describe a certain string of logic through source text is to be subjectively or collectively notated but not strictly.

The logical reasoning and turing completeness of the language has no change. Such an abstraction
enables alternative semantics, arguably better yet, a mobile collective representation in interpretation of logic. As a matter 
of fact, the basis of this idea depends enabling that exact evolution.
